US Fed Gov Google Analytics Drupal Module
=========================================

Embeds appropriate GA javascript file for US federal agencies

ALPHA RELEASE NOTES:

This module contains a submodule in the js folder that pulls in code from https://github.com/GSA/DAP-Gov-wide-GA-Code

To update the javascript files from the GSA repository above, make sure you clone this repo recursively.

To change the agency js file, you must modify the code in the dot module file. Next steps are to make this
possible via an admin gui.
